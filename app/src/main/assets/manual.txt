Welcome to RubiColour!

We would like to give you a brief introduction
of how to work with this application.

Before getting started, it is important to
mention that this app currently only works
for the 'One-Plus One' however, there will
follow an update shortly. Furthermore it is
important to notice that color identification
currently does not work for every cube, only
for the standard rubiks cube.

1. By clicking 'Proceed' a rotating-3-dimensional
rubiks cube will appear on the screen. This
is the default waiting state of the app.

2. Now by clicking anywhere on the screen, a
custom camera with a 3x3 grid will appear.
Focus the camera on the cube from above and
take a photograph. !!! Please note the order
in which the cube has to be photographed:
First the above (white) face, then the red
(front) face, -> bottom (yellow) face ->
rotate back to front face and turn
clockwise, (blue) face -> clockwise back
(orange) face -> clockwise left (green) face.

3. After having captured all 6 faces, press the
'prune' button once again and the Singmaster
string should appear. If color-checking
algorithm has detected an error, it will
tell you so.

4. By clicking 'Nope' you will be returned
to the default-waiting screen.

4.1 By clicking 'Sure' you will be returned
to the 3x3 matrix, so that another cube can
be pruned.

Shortly following improvements:
- Only 5 faces will have to be photographed
- Color adjustments can be made
- Compatible with other droids

About:
This application was made by Thomas Schaschinger
(thomas.schaschinger@gmail.com) for a school
project - Running a rubiks cube solver on
my computer where Singmaster notation is needed
as default input -> 6 stepper motors rotate
cube in under 2 seconds back to original state.
