# RubiColour_Repository
In order to scan the rubics cube with my smartphone camera, I programmed this application to operate on my Anroid phone.
What it does is fairly basic, it accesses the camera, draws a 3x3 grid across the screen which is used for orientation
for the alignment of the lense over the surface of one side of the cube.
After having photographed all six sides (I am aware that it is technically requried to only photograph 5 or 4 sides of the cube
,which I might implement eventually) it computes the Singmaster notation which is required to solve the cube.

See the project demonstration here:
